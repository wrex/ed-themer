<h1>WK Elementary Dark Themer</h1>

<p>
	This app lets you create a set of "CSS custom properties" to override the default color scheme of
	the Elementary Dark stylesheet for <a href="https://www.wanikani.com">WaniKani.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Top navigation</h2>
<p>The dropdown widget changes which mockup to display (surfaces, dashboard, or reviews).</p>
<p>
	<span class="iconButton" role="button">
		<CollapseLeftIcon />
	</span> shrinks the left panel to give you more screen real estate.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="iconButton" role="button">
		<ReloadIcon />
	</span> resets all of the user styles on the left to the defaults.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="iconButton" role="button">
		<ExportIcon />
	</span> displays all of the current user style settings, and allows you to copy them to your clipboard.
</p>

<h2>Props Sidebar</h2>

<p>
	This is where you create all of your preferred user styles. If the props sidebar is currently
	collapsed, first expand it using the expand button in the top navigation.
</p>

<p>
	Click any of the categories to display the user style settings available. Each category has
	several user properties that you can adjust.
</p>

<h3>Color picker</h3>
<p>
	There are two ways to define the color for a given user property: using a color picker/mixer, or
	by selecting any of the other user properties in a dropdown.
</p>
<p>
	Click on the color swatch to adjust the desired color for that property. The sample in the center
	of your screen will adapt to the new settings as you make changes. You may need to change the
	sample type (using the dropdown at the top) in order to see what a given property affects.
</p>

<p>
	Alternately, you can click the dropdown to reference any other user property. This will
	automatically change the color displayed immediately above the dropdown. Once another property is
	selected, this color will change as that other property is adjusted.
</p>

<p>
	Note that using the color picker on top for any property will automatically revert the dropdown to
	"Custom", and using the dropdown will automatically set the color picker to the current value of
	the other property.
</p>

<h3>Eyedropper feature</h3>
<p>
	The color picker is controlled by your browser, but most (all?) modern browsers include an
	"eyedropper" feature to pick up any other color on your screen. This is particularly handy if
	you'd like to use a consistent palette of colors rather than manually mixing every custom color.
	You can pick colors from the palette you create below, or from a photograph or anything else
	currently displayed on your screen.
</p>

<h3>Color palette</h3>

<p>
	At the bottom of your screen are rows of swatches you can use as you develop your color scheme. By
	default, one row of gray swatches (centered on "#888888"), and one row of a random color in
	different tints and shades are displayed. Seven shades of the center color are displayed to the
	left, and seven tints to the right.
</p>

<p>
	Each tint/shade mixes an increasing amount of white or black to the central color, from 13% in the
	first step, to 91% in the last step.
</p>

<p>
	The center of each row is a standard color picker: adjusting the color of the center swatch will
	change the tints and shades shown to the right and left of the color picker as well.
</p>

<p>
	<span role="button" class="iconButton">-</span> removes any given row of swatches. (The top row cannot
	be removed).
</p>

<h3>Palette controls</h3>

<p>
	<span role="button" class="iconButton">Palette</span> let's you copy the palette of all palette swatches
	to your clipboard if you'd like to use them elsewhere. Note that using the eyedropper tool to select
	one of these swatches unfortunately just sets the hex color value for that user property, and doesn't
	reference this palette property in the generated CSS.
</p>

<p>
	<span role="button" class="iconButton">+</span> adds rows of swatches (up to a maximum of 20 rows).
</p>

<p>The dropdown controls how many rows are created and the initial colors for those rows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"Custom (+1)" creates a single row with a random initial color.</li>
	<li>
		"Complementary (+1)" also creates a single row, but chooses a hue that is the complement (180째
		opposite on the color wheel) of the center color of the current bottom row.
	</li>
	<li>
		"Analagous (+2)" generates two more rows, each hue 30째 away (but adjacent to) the bottom color's
		hue.
	</li>
	<li>
		"Triadic (+2)" also generates two more rows, but these are each 120째 away. This tends to
		generate a very balanced color scheme.
	</li>
	<li>"Tetradic (+3)" generated three more rows, each 90째 away.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Note that as currently implemented, this palette tool only creates tints and shades, it doesn't
	create any "tones" by mixing middle gray.
</p>
