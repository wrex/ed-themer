# Elementary Dark Themer

This is an auxiliary app for the [WaniKani Elementary
Dark](https://github.com/Sepitus-exe/WKElementaryDark) project.

## TODO

- refactor to clean up the code

- Let users reorder palette bar rows (drag and drop).

- Let users select which input to use as the basis for adding rows (unnecessary
  if rows can be reordered?)
